## Project Name: Cybersecurity DNS Traffic Analysis

### Overview

This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity measures by employing advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to analyze Domain Name System (DNS) traffic. By harnessing the power of these cutting-edge approaches, the system aims to accurately classify and identify malicious domains. Through the intricate analysis of DNS traffic patterns, the model can distinguish between legitimate and potentially harmful domains, providing a robust defense against cyber threats. This innovative approach not only enhances the efficiency of malicious domain detection but also contributes to the continual evolution of cybersecurity frameworks in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

### Usage

- **Setup**: Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

- **Data**: The project offers a variety of data-related directories:
  - `data/raw`: Contains original, immutable data dumps.
  - `data/external`: Holds data from third-party sources.
  - `data/interim`: Stores intermediate data that has been transformed.
  - `data/processed`: Contains the final, canonical data sets for modeling.

- **Models**: Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries are stored in the `models` directory.

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks are available in the `notebooks` directory for various purposes such as data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

- **Scripts**: Source code is organized under `src`, comprising modules for data processing (`data`), feature engineering (`features`), model training and prediction (`models`), and visualization (`visualization`).

- **Reports**: Generated analysis in formats like HTML, PDF, or LaTeX can be found in the `reports` directory. Associated figures and graphics are stored in the `reports/figures` subdirectory.
